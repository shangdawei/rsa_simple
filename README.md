# RSA

## Summery
Simple RSA implementation with a detail to readabiltiy, meant to demonstrate
how the algorithm works. The C programming language was chosen for this implementation
due to the similarity in syntax to other languages.

## The Algorithm
### RSA Algorithm
**Based on**: ((m\*\*e)\*\*d) % n = m
e : encryption, d: decryption

**Encryption**: ciphertext = (message**e) % n
**Decryption**: (c**d == (m**e)**d == m)  % n

### Key Generation
*p* and *q*, two distrinct prime numbers
*n = pq*

fi is Euler's Totient Function
fi(n) = fi(p) * fi(q) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = n - (p + q - 1)

chose e, *the public key* so that:
      1. 1 < e < fi(n)
      2. gcd(e, fi(n)) == 1 (i.e. e and fi(n) are coprime

chose d, *the private key* so that:
      1. d == (e **-1) % fi(n)
      ...d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo(fi(n))

## Compile
Create test binary
```bash
make tests
```

Recompile tests
```bash
make re-tests
```

Create RSA binary
```bash
make
```

Remove object files created durring build
```bash
make clean
```

Remove object files and binaries
```bash
make fclean
```
